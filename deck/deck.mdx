# The Complexity in Simplicity

# So that you can click a button a lot of complexity happens behind the scenes

---

## We take the complexity so you don't have to

---

## Making the web easier and more accessible is on us

---

## Ever looked at a webpage and thought
## You DO NOT need to do this

## What does that even mean?

---

# Let's talk forms
<Appear>
  <h3>Forms are the Paris Beauvais Airport of the internet</h3>
</Appear>

---

# Code? Code!

---

# Languages are hard

---

<CodeSurfer>

```js title="Get the browser language"
navigator.languages
  ? navigator.languages[0]
  : navigator.language || navigator.userLanguage || "en";
```

</CodeSurfer>

---

# Addresses are even harder

---

<CodeSurfer>

```jsx
  <label>
    <input
      type="checkbox"
      checked={!showBilling}
      onClick={() => setShowBilling(!showBilling)}
    />
    Billing data equal to shipping data
  </label>
```

# Accessability

---
### Placeholders are not read by assistive technology
---
### Placeholders do not get translated
---
### Placeholders are not labels
---

<CodeSurfer>

```jsx
import React, { useState } from "react";
import uniqueId from "lodash/uniqueId";
import styled, { css } from "styled-components";

const Wrapper = styled.div`
  input:focus + label,
  input:valid + label {
    display: none;
  }
  ${props =>
    !props.empty &&
    css`
      input:invalid + label {
        display: none;
      }
  `}
`;

export default ({ type = "text", label, ...props }) => {
  const [id] = useState(() => uniqueId("checkout-"));
  const [value, setValue] = useState("");
  return (
    <Wrapper empty={Boolean(!value)}>
      <input
        onChange={e => setValue(e.target.value)}
        type={type}
        id={id}
      />
      <label htmlFor={id}>{label}</label>
    </Wrapper>
  );
