# The Complexity in Simplicity

# I work at CodeSandbox

# A button can do 100 different things

# So that you can click a button a lot of complexity happens behind the scenes

---

## We take the complexity so you don't have to

---

## Making the web easier and more accessible is on us

---

## Ever looked at a webpage and thought
## You DO NOT need to do this

---

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/ifOuWCc.png" />

---

## What does that even mean?

---

# Let's talk forms
<Appear>
  <h3>Forms are the Paris Beauvais Airport of the internet</h3>
</Appear>

---

# Code? Code!

---

# Languages are hard

---

<CodeSurfer>

```js title="Get the browser language"
navigator.languages
  ? navigator.languages[0]
  : navigator.language || navigator.userLanguage || "en";
```

</CodeSurfer>

---

# Addresses are even harder

---

<CodeSurfer>

```jsx
  <label>
    <input
      type="checkbox"
      checked={!showBilling}
      onClick={() => setShowBilling(!showBilling)}
    />
    Billing data equal to shipping data
  </label>
```

# Accessability

---
### Placeholders are not read by some assistive technology
---
### Placeholders do not get translated
---
### Placeholders are not labels
---

<CodeSurfer>

```jsx
const topLabel = css`
  font-size: 11px;
  transform: translateY(-30px) translateX(10px);
`;

const Wrapper = styled.div`
  label {
    position: absolute;
    top: 50%;
    transform: translateY(-50%) translateX(20px);
    color: #737373;
    transition: all 200ms ease;
  }

  input:focus + label,
  input:valid + label {
    ${topLabel}
  }

  ${props =>
    !props.empty &&
    css`
      input:invalid + label {
        ${topLabel}
      }
    `}
`;

export default ({ onChange, type = "text", label, ...props }) => {
  const [id] = useState(() => uniqueId("checkout-"));
  const [value, setValue] = useState("");
  return (
    <Wrapper empty={Boolean(!value)}>
      <input
        type={type}
        id={id}
        name={id}
      />
      <label htmlFor={id}>{label}</label>
    </Wrapper>
  );
};

## Custom Selects?
---
## https://doineedacustomselect.com
---
## Credit Cards
---

## Do not ask me the type of card I have
---

## You can do this with a regex

---


<CodeSurfer>

```js
export const GetCardType = number => {
  // visa
  let re = new RegExp("^4");
  if (number.match(re) != null) return "Visa";

  // Mastercard
  re = new RegExp("^5[1-5]");
  if (number.match(re) != null) return "Mastercard";

  // AMEX
  re = new RegExp("^3[47]");
  if (number.match(re) != null) return "AMEX";

  // Discover
  re = new RegExp(
    "^(6011|622(12[6-9]|1[3-9][0-9]|[2-8][0-9]{2}|9[0-1][0-9]|92[0-5]|64[4-9])|65)"
  );
  if (number.match(re) != null) return "Discover";

  // Visa Electron
  re = new RegExp("^(4026|417500|4508|4844|491(3|7))");
  if (number.match(re) != null) return "Visa Electron";

  return "";
};

```

## It's not pretty but good UX

---

## That's the whole idea

---

## You take the burden so that the users don't have to

---

## Your pretty code won't make your users come back

---

## With small additions we can make my mom pay the rest of the bills in her phone

---

### With additions like these we can have more CodeSandboxes
### We can have more people coding

---
